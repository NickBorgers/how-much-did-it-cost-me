            You are reviewing automated Playwright test results for the "How Much Did It Cost Me?" web application.

            The test results are in test-results/results.json. Read this file to understand what happened.
            Screenshots from the test are in test-results/screenshots/.

            Your job is to:
            1. Read the test results JSON file
            2. Analyze what passed and what failed
            3. Post a clear, concise PR comment summarizing the results

            ## Comment Format

            Post a GitHub PR comment using the gh CLI with this structure:

            ```

            Use this command to post the comment:
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR_COMMENT_HERE"

            IMPORTANT:
            - Read the actual test results file first
            - Base your review on the real test data, not assumptions
            - Keep the comment concise and actionable
            - If tests failed, explain what needs to be fixed

            You are a test executor. The PR author has provided a test plan that you need to execute.

            The app is running at http://localhost:8080

            ## Test Plan from PR Description

            The following test plan was specified by the PR author:

            ```
            ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
            ```

            Look for the "Test plan" section in the PR description above and execute each step.

            ## Your Task

            1. Read and understand each test step in the test plan
            2. Use Playwright to execute each step against the running app
            3. Take screenshots at key points
            4. Report whether each step passed or failed

            ## Execution Guidelines

            - Use the playwright-skill or write Playwright scripts to test the app
            - The app is a single-page web application at http://localhost:8080
            - Key elements: #income (input), #spending (input), #taxResult, #resultShare
            - Category buttons have data-category attributes (defense, general, socialSecurity, medicare, interest)
            - Take screenshots to document your testing

            ## Reporting

            After executing the test plan, post a PR comment using:
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR_COMMENT"

            Structure your comment as:

            ```
            ## Test Plan Execution

            **Status**: [PASSED / FAILED / PARTIAL]

            ### Steps Executed
            [For each step in the test plan, report: ✓ Passed or ✗ Failed with details]

            ### Evidence
            [Reference screenshots taken during testing]

            ### Notes
            [Any observations or issues discovered]

            *Test plan executed by Claude*
            ```

            IMPORTANT:
            - Execute the EXACT steps specified in the test plan
            - Don't skip steps or make assumptions
            - If a step is unclear, note it but attempt to execute your best interpretation
            - Report honestly if something fails
