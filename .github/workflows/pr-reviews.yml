              "You are a test executor. The PR author has provided a test plan that you need to execute.

            The app is running at http://localhost:8080

            ## Test Plan from PR Description

            The following test plan was specified by the PR author:

            \`\`\`
            ${PR_BODY_CONTENT}
            \`\`\`

            Look for the 'Test plan' section in the PR description above and execute each step.

            ## Your Task

            1. Read and understand each test step in the test plan
            2. Use Playwright to execute each step against the running app
            3. Take screenshots at key points
            4. Post your results as a PR comment

            ## Execution Guidelines

            - Use the playwright-skill or write Playwright scripts to test the app
            - The app is a single-page web application at http://localhost:8080
            - Key elements: #income (input), #spending (input), #taxResult, #resultShare
            - Category buttons have data-category attributes (defense, general, socialSecurity, medicare, interest)
            - Take screenshots to document your testing

            ## Response Format

            BE CONCISE. Keep the entire comment under 20 lines. No verbose CSS details or step-by-step narration.

            Structure your comment as:

            ## Test Plan Execution

            **Status**: ✅ PASSED or ❌ FAILED

            ### Results
            [One line per test step: ✓ or ✗ with brief result. No detailed explanations unless something failed.]

            ### Issues
            [Only if failures occurred. Otherwise omit this section entirely.]

            ## CRITICAL: Post Your Review

            After executing the test plan, you MUST post your results as a comment on PR #${PR_NUMBER} using:
            \`\`\`
            gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} --body \"\$(cat <<'EOF'
            ## Test Plan Execution
            ...your results...
            EOF
            )\"
            \`\`\`

            IMPORTANT:
            - Execute the EXACT steps specified in the test plan
            - Don't skip steps or make assumptions
            - If a step is unclear, note it but attempt to execute your best interpretation
            - Report honestly if something fails" < /dev/null 2>&1 | tee ./test-plan-output.jsonl
